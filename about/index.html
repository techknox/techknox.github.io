    <h3 class="title">Welcome to TechKnoxville!</h3>
    <p>An organization devoted to increasing Tech opportunities in the great city of Knoxville, Tennessee!</p>
    <p>We love Knoxville. It's a safe and beautiful city nestled in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. According to <a href="http://visitknoxville.com/">VisitKnoxville.com</a>, it serves as the perfect blend of southern hospitality and modern development. We've got lots of great people, an awesome downtown, shopping, festivals, arts &amp; entertainment, and are in close proximity to just about every outdoor activity you can imagine!</p>
    <p>We have lots of talented people here, but lose many of them to cities with more Technical opportunities. It is our desire to help grow and organize the Technical community here in Knoxville. It is our hope that by doing so, we can increase the technical opportunities available while cultivating our skillsets and raising the community's Tech Awareness.</p>

    <h4>We think a great place to start would be :</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Organize Regular Technical Meet-ups</li>
      <li>Organize Conferences and Events around the Tech Community</li>
      <li>Free Beginner classes in Different Programming Languages</li>
      <li>Mailing Lists and Informative Blog Posts on local Tech</li>
      <li>Maintain an updated local listing of Opportunities in Knoxville</li>
      <li>Maintain a list of local talent for hiring or just to contract on your next project</li>
      <li>Organize Regular Think-Tanks where entrepeneurs can bounce ideas off each other, and find potential investors</li>
    </ul>
