Welcome to the TechKnoxville, or TechKnox, site. We'll try our best to post 
useful information here when we can.

We have a [Slack Team Chat](https://techknox.slack.com) setup for anyone who
wants to talk to local talent as well as find help from others. We aren't
limited to a single technology, everyone is welcome.

Right now we have an active Ruby on Rails group, check out the 
[Meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/Knoxville-Ruby-On-Rails-Meetup/) for more info.
